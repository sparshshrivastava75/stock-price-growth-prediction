Introduction
Stock price prediction is a complex task that involves analyzing historical market data and using various techniques to forecast future prices. This project aims to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict stock prices using a given dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the data directory. It contains historical stock price data, including features like opening price, closing price, volume, and more. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

Model Architecture
The stock price prediction model employs a combination of machine learning techniques, including time series analysis and deep learning. The core of the model is built using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. This architecture allows the model to capture temporal dependencies in the data, making it suitable for time series prediction tasks.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sparshshrivastava75/stock-price-growth-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset and place it in the data directory.

Usage
To train and evaluate the stock price prediction model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_and_evaluate.py
This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance on the test dataset. The results will be displayed in the terminal.

Results
After running the model, you will see the evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy in predicting stock prices. Experiment with hyperparameters and data preprocessing techniques to improve the results.
